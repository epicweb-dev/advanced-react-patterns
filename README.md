## Prerequisites

- The more experience you have with building React abstractions, the more
  helpful this workshop will be for you.

## Pre-workshop Resources

Here are some resources you can read before taking the workshop to get you up to
speed on some of the tools and concepts we'll be covering:

- [Inversion of Control](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/inversion-of-control)
- [Implement Inversion of Control](https://egghead.io/lessons/egghead-implement-inversion-of-control?pl=kent-s-blog-posts-as-screencasts-eefa540c&af=5236ad)

## System Requirements

- [git][git] v2.18 or greater
- [NodeJS][node] v18 or greater
- [npm][npm] v8 or greater

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```shell
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment
variable and how to fix it here for [windows][win-path] or
[mac/linux][mac-path].

## Setup

This is a pretty large project (it's actually many apps in one) so it can take
several minutes to get everything set up the first time. Please have a strong
network connection before running the setup and grab a snack.

Follow these steps to get this set up:

```sh nonumber
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/epicweb-dev/advanced-react-patterns.git
cd advanced-react-patterns
npm run setup
```

If you experience errors here, please open [an issue][issue] with as many
details as you can offer.
