# State Reducer

**One liner:** The State Reducer Pattern inverts control over the state
management of your hook and/or component to the developer using it so they can
control the state changes that happen when dispatching events.

During the life of a reusable component which is used in many different
contexts, feature requests are made over and over again to handle different
cases and cater to different scenarios.

We could definitely add props to our component and add logic in our reducer for
how to handle these different cases, but there's a never ending list of logical
customizations that people could want out of our custom hook and we don't want
to have to code for every one of those cases.
