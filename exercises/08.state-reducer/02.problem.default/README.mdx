# Default State Reducer

👨‍💼 Our `toggleReducer` is pretty simple, so it's not a huge pain for people to
implement their own. However, in a more realistic scenario, people may struggle
with having to basically re-implement our entire reducer which could be pretty
complex.

So for the this step, we're going to `export` the default reducer so people can
use that inside their own reducers as needed.

Go ahead and do this by changing the `toggleStateReducer` function inside the
`<App />` example to use the default reducer instead of having to re-implement
what to do when the action type is `'reset'`.
