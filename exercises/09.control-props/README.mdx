# Control Props

<callout-success>
	**One liner:** The Control Props pattern allows users to completely control
	state values within your component. This differs from the state reducer
	pattern in the fact that you can not only change the state changes based on
	actions dispatched but you _also_ can trigger state changes from outside the
	component or hook as well.
</callout-success>

Sometimes, people want to be able to manage the internal state of our component
from the outside. The state reducer allows them to manage what state changes are
made when a state change happens, but sometimes people may want to make state
changes themselves. We can allow them to do this with a feature called "Control
Props."

This concept is basically the same as
[controlled form elements ðŸ“œ](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/input#controlling-an-input-with-a-state-variable)
in React that you've probably used many times.

```tsx
function MyCapitalizedInput() {
	const [capitalizedValue, setCapitalizedValue] = useState('')

	return (
		<input
			value={capitalizedValue}
			onChange={e => setCapitalizedValue(e.target.value.toUpperCase())}
		/>
	)
}
```

In this case, the "component" that's implemented the "control props" pattern is
the `<input />`. Normally it controls state itself (like if you render
`<input />` by itself with no `value` prop). But once you add the `value` prop,
suddenly the `<input />` takes the back seat and instead makes "suggestions" to
you via the `onChange` prop on the state updates that it would normally make
itself.

This flexibility allows us to change how the state is managed (by capitalizing
the value), and it also allows us to programmatically change the state whenever
we want to, which enables this kind of synchronized input situation:

```tsx
function MyTwoInputs() {
	const [capitalizedValue, setCapitalizedValue] = useState('')
	const [lowerCasedValue, setLowerCasedValue] = useState('')

	function handleInputChange(e) {
		setCapitalizedValue(e.target.value.toUpperCase())
		setLowerCasedValue(e.target.value.toLowerCase())
	}

	return (
		<>
			<input value={capitalizedValue} onChange={handleInputChange} />
			<input value={lowerCasedValue} onChange={handleInputChange} />
		</>
	)
}
```
