# Control Props

👨‍💼 In this exercise, we've created a `<Toggle />` component which can accept a
prop called `on` and another called `onChange`. These work similar to the
`value` and `onChange` props of `<input />`. Your job is to make those props
actually control the state of `on` and call the `onChange` with the suggested
changes.
