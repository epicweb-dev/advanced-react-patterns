# Initialize Toggle

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicreact.dev/workshops/advanced-react-patterns/initialize-toggle" />

👨‍💼 Our toggle component should be able to be customizable for the initial state
and reset to the initial state.

🧝‍♂️ I've updated the toggle component to use a reducer instead of `useState`. If
you'd like to back up, and do that yourself in the playground, be my guest. Or
you can <PrevDiffLink>check my work</PrevDiffLink> instead.

👨‍💼 Please add a case in our reducer for the `reset` logic, and add an option to
our `useToggle` hook for setting the initialOn state.
