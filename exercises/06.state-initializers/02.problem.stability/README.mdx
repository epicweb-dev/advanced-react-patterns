# Stability

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicreact.dev/workshops/advanced-react-patterns/stability" />

👨‍💼 We've noticed that if someone passes an `initialOn` that's based on state,
then calling `reset` will sometimes change the state to the wrong value based on
what the `initialOn` was set to at the time the component was initialized.

This is confusing and we want to make certain to avoid it.

🧝‍♂️ I've put together a simple example of this for you to experiment with. You'll
notice we now have a button for toggling the `initialOn` state which we pass as
an option to `useToggle`. So if you toggle the `initialOn` state and then click
the reset button, you'll notice it resets to the current `initialOn` state, not
the original one.

👨‍💼 This is a little confusing for users of the `useToggle` hook, so please fix
this issue! Thanks!
