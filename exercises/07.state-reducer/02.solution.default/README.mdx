# Default State Reducer

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicreact.dev/workshops/advanced-react-patterns/default-state-reducer/solution" />

👨‍💼 It's a pretty simple, yet powerful solution. Inversion of control with good
defaults allows our component users to have a lot more power and will reduce the
amount of feature requests you get for these components by a lot, I promise.

🦉 An important thing to note is that once you do this your internal state
becomes a part of your public API. So if you change the name of an internal
state variable, then that will be a breaking change for your users. So be
careful with this.

🕷 With great power comes great responsibility.
