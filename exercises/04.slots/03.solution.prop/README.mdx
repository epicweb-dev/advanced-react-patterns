👨‍💼 Great! Now we can use the same component for multiple slots!

One thing to note is that there's not a great way to have good type safety on
these props, though if you're creative, you could add nice runtime errors,
[for example](https://github.com/adobe/react-spectrum/blob/3db98d2d378f977a88d94e9f2501feca8ef8ce51/packages/react-aria-components/src/utils.tsx#L169-L181).
