# State Initializer

<callout-success>
	**One liner:** The state initializer pattern is a way to initialize (and
	reset) the state of a component in a predictable way.
</callout-success>

This one is simple in concept:

```tsx
function useCounter() {
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
	const increment = () => setCount(c => c + 1)
	return { count, increment }
}
```

If I wanted to initialize the state of the count to a different value, I could
do so by passing an argument to the `useCounter` function:

```tsx
function useCounter({ initialCount = 0 } = {}) {
	const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount)
	const increment = () => setCount(c => c + 1)
	return { count, increment }
}
```

And often when you have a state initializer, you also have a state resetter:

```tsx
function useCounter({ initialCount = 0 } = {}) {
	const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount)
	const increment = () => setCount(c => c + 1)
	const reset = () => setCount(initialCount)
	return { count, increment, reset }
}
```

But there's a catch. If you truly want to reset the component to its _initial_
state, then you need to make certain that any changes to the `initialCount` are
ignored!

You can do this, by using a `ref` which will keep the initial value constant
across renders:

```tsx
function useCounter({ initialCount = 0 } = {}) {
	const initialCountRef = useRef(initialCount)
	const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCountRef.current)
	const increment = () => setCount(c => c + 1)
	const reset = () => setCount(initialCountRef.current)
	return { count, increment, reset }
}
```

And that's the crux of the state initializer pattern.
