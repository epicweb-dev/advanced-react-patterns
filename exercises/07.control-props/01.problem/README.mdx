# Control Props

In this exercise, we've created a `<Toggle />` component which can accept a prop
called `on` and another called `onChange`. These work similar to the `value` and
`onChange` props of `<input />`. Your job is to make those props actually
control the state of `on` and call the `onChange` with the suggested changes.

<section id="files" className="not-prose">
  <h2>Files</h2>

  <ul>
    <li data-state="modified">
      <span>modified</span>

      <InlineFile file="toggle.tsx" />
    </li>

  </ul>
</section>
