# Generic Slot Components

üë®‚Äçüíº You'll notice our party mode toggle button is using `useId` to properly
associate the toggle button with its label. We'd like to make that implicit and
reuse the `Label` component for the `Toggle` as well.

Please update the `Toggle` component in <InlineFile file="toggle.tsx" /> to
render a `SlotContext` provider (in addition to the `ToggleContext` provider
it's already rendering) so it can provide props for a `label` slot (the slot
name for a `Label`). You'll also want to put the `id` in the `ToggleContext` so
the `ToggleButton` can grab it.

Once you're finished with that, you can remove the manual `id`/`htmlFor` props
in the <InlineFile file="app.tsx" /> file and the `id` should be provided
automatically.
