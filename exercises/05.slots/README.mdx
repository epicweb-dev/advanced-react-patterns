# Slots

<callout-success>
	**One liner:** Slots allow you to specify an element which takes on a
	particular role in the overall collection of components.

This pattern is particularly useful for situations where you're building a UI
library with a lot of components that need to work together. It's a way to
provide a flexible API for your components that allows them to be used in a
variety of contexts.

If you're building a component library, you have to deal with two competing
interests:

1. Correctness
2. Flexibility

You want to make sure people don't mess up things like accessibility, but you
also want to give them the flexibility to build things the way their diverse
needs require. Slots can help with this.

Here's a quick example of a component that uses slots (from the
[`react-aria`](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/index.html) docs):

```tsx
<CheckboxGroup>
	<Label>Pets</Label>
	<MyCheckbox value="dogs">Dogs</MyCheckbox>
	<MyCheckbox value="cats">Cats</MyCheckbox>
	<MyCheckbox value="dragons">Dragons</MyCheckbox>
	<Text slot="description">Select your pets.</Text>
</CheckboxGroup>
```

The `slot="description"` prop is letting the `Text` component know that it needs
to look for special props that are meant to be used as a description. Those
special props will be provided by the `CheckboxGroup` component.

Essentially, the `CheckboxGroup` component will say: "here's a bucket of props
for any component that takes on the role of a description." The `Text` component
will then say: "Oh look, I've got a `slot` prop that matches the `description`
slot, so I'll use these props to render myself."

All of this is built using context.

What this enables is a powerfully flexible capability to have components which
are highly reusable. The `Text` component can be used in many different
contexts, and it can adapt to the needs of the parent component. For example,
it's also used in react-aria's `ComboBox` components. Here's the anatomy of a
react-aria `ComboBox` component:

```tsx lines=5,10,11
<ComboBox>
	<Label />
	<Input />
	<Button />
	<Text slot="description" />
	<FieldError />
	<Popover>
		<ListBox>
			<ListBoxItem>
				<Text slot="label" />
				<Text slot="description" />
			</ListBoxItem>
			<Section>
				<Header />
				<ListBoxItem />
			</Section>
		</ListBox>
	</Popover>
</ComboBox>
```

This can be used to apply appropriate `aria-` attributes as well as `id`s and
event handlers. You might think about it as a way to implement compound
components in a way that doesn't require an individual component for every
single use case.

## Implementation

Folks tend to struggle with this one a bit more than the rest, but it's simpler
than it seems.

The basic concept is your root component creates collections of props like so:

```tsx
function NumberField({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
	// setup state/events/etc

	const slots = {
		label: { htmlFor: inputId },
		decrement: { onClick: decrement },
		increment: { onClick: increment },
		description: { id: descriptionId },
		input: { id: inputId, 'aria-describedby': descriptionId },
	}
	return <SlotContext.Provider value={slots}>{children}</SlotContext.Provider>
}
```

Then the consuming components use the `use(SlotContext)` to get access to the
`slots` object and pluck off the props they need to do their job:

```tsx
function Input(props) {
	props = useSlotProps(props, 'input')

	return <input {...props}>
}
```

The `useSlotProps` hook is responsible for taking the props that have been
specified and combining it with those from the `SlotContext` for the named slot.
