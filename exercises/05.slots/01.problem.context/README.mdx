# Slot Context

üë®‚Äçüíº It's a tale as old as time. Our `label` and `input` are not properly
associated in this form and so clicking the `label` will not focus the `input`
as expected (in addition to other accessibility issues).

But we don't want developers to be able to make this mistake. So we've made a
`TextField` component which will generate the `id` for the relationship (if one
is not provided). The tricky bit is we want people to be able to structure their
label and input however they want, so we can't render the `input` and `label`
for them. Instead, we want to be able to provide the `id` and `htmlFor` props to
the `label` and `input`.

So what we want you to do is first create a `SlotContext` and `useSlotProps`
hook in <InlineFile file="slots.tsx" />, then use those in the `Label` and
`Input` components to retrieve the necessary props.

The `useSlotProps` hook should accept a props object and a slot name and return
the props to be applied to the element for that slot. It should merge the props
it's been given with the props from the `SlotContext` for that slot.

Once you've finished that, then render the `SlotContext` provider in the
`TextField` component in <InlineFile file="text-field.tsx" /> to provide slot
props for the `label` and `input`.

When you're finished, the label and input should be properly associated and
clicking the label should focus the input.
