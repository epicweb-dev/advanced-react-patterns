# Slot Prop

üë®‚Äçüíº We have `ToggleOn` and `ToggleOff` components, but really we could make those
components a simple `Text` component that accepts a `slot` prop. Then the
`Toggle` component could define the props that the individual `Text` components
should have based on which slot they're taking.

In fact, we could do this with the `Switch` as well!

üßù‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I've added `Text` and `Switch` components to the
<InlineFile file="slots.tsx" /> file for you to use. These are both already
wired up to consume a `slot` named `text` and `switch`. You can
<DiffLink app1={-1}>check the diff</DiffLink> for details.

What we want to do in this exercise is add a `slot` prop to each of our slot
components so the slot they're taking can be defined by the parent component.

Then you'll need to update `Toggle` to get rid of the `ToggleContext` provider
and instead use the `SlotProvider` for all the components it wants to send props
to:

- `label` - `htmlFor`
- `onText` - `hidden` (`undefined` if `isOn` is true, and `true` if `isOn` is
  `false`)
- `offText` - `hidden` (`undefined` if `isOn` is false, and `true` if `isOn` is
  `true`)
- `switch` - `id`, `on`, and `onClick`

So by the end of all of this, here's what I want the API to be like:

```tsx
<Toggle>
	<Label>Party mode</Label>
	<Switch />
	<Text slot="onText">Let's party ü•≥</Text>
	<Text slot="offText">Sad town üò≠</Text>
</Toggle>
```

Once that's been updated, you can delete the `useToggle` hook and the
`ToggleOn`, `ToggleOff`, and `ToggleButton` components.

Reusability FTW!
